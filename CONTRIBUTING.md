# How to contribute

Before you start developing, please start a discussion or open an issue. In principle, 
pull requests are very welcome. However, contributing to the `datarhei Restreamer` is 
currently sometimes tricky. We know this and are working on official guidelines to understand the code structures better.

If you have any questions, you can also send us an email at support@datarhei.com.
